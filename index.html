      <h2>Programmer in Learning</h2>
      <p>Hi I'm Melanie I'm 21, I have a diploma in tourism. After my years of school I was finally not so inspired for my carreer, so I decided to travel. I lived few month in New-Zelande where I realize the importance to found something I love in life. That why I decided to start Le Wagon. Learn code is about work for any company, all around the world, that can offer me freedom of traveling, and lot of and creativity. Now I'm more than ever in love with code.</p>
